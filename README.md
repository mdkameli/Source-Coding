# Source-Coding
Presented project provides implementation of DPCM (Differential Pulse-Code Modulation) in MATLABÂ® which is followed by Golomb Coding to compress the CD-quality audio signals (16 bit/sample) in a lossy coding technique.
The goal of the reports is the following:
1- Developing an algorithm for encoding and decoding CD-quality audio signals (16 bit/sample) by means of the DPCM technique.
2- Using a linear predictor of order N = 1; 2; 4.
3- Using a Golomb code for coding the prediction error.
4- Computing the rate and SNR for different combinations of predictors and number of quantization levels using different kind of audio signals (voice, music of different genre).
